	<td align='left'>Broken some things, fixed some things. In general I'm trying to improve UI on mobiles. BUT there's a new feature now mostly for desktops. If you think there might be a better translation of some text, select it and press Ctrl+Enter. Unfortunately, it's impossible to select a text on e.g. a button in such a way, so you can just press Ctrl+Enter and enter what to replace manually. Only original and suggested texts, current page and selected language are tracked.</td></tr>

	<td align='left'>Fixed a bug that some multi-reports were opened incorrectly—no need to save again, links should work.<br>Fixed problem with parsing artefacts, should work at least for English, German and some other languages.<br>Actually, I'm constantly monitoring possible errors and unrecognized information messages, names of buildings, artefacts etc from reports and updating translations. If your report wasn't recognized correctly, try again in a day or two.<br>Having artefact names will help sped up that process, though. Consider sending me names of artifacts in your language in a way more suitable for you—contacts are on updated <a href="about.html">about page</a>. Thanks for patience and using my tools. Together we can do a better tools for Travian.</td></tr>

<tr><td>08.08.18</td>
	<td align='left'>How to calculate the most efficient army for the server with merge troops function? One option is to use the power of custom formula in attributes calculator for certain hourly production w/o gold. Merged troops costs 3x just as in Great Barracks/Stables. Quick math (you can skip to the link): for every unit produced we merge x units, <nobr>hourly production = tc/t + 3x·tc/t</nobr>, and off-points generated for that hourly production is <nobr>a·(x+1)/t</nobr>. If we express x from hourly production, we will get the <a href="war.html#s=1.432&stat_sum=16&lvl=20&hd_lvl=20&item=5&func=a*(50k%2Ftc%2B2%2Ft)%2F3">following result</a>, replace 50k with your hourly production. BTW for small production, like &lt; 20k, formula <a href="war.html#s=1.432&stat_sum=16&lvl=20&item=5&func=min(a*(50k%2Ftc)%2Ca*(50k%2Ftc%2B2%2Ft)%2F3)">needs to be corrected</a>, but working with it requires changing hourly production twice.<br>This method works for single units, what if we want to see overall picture? There's a trick in offense calculator. Since merging troops is like great barracks, it's allowed to input great barracks level &gt; 20 to emulate merging troops. <a href="off_calc.html#b=20,39,20,0,0,0&p=100,0,0&r=1&t=2190&s=1.44&h=20&po&art=100&hm=20,15&rb=10">Play with it</a>, while keeping an eye on resources needed per hour—they are conveniently displayed on the right side—and find your optimal army conmposition.</td></tr>
